# Python-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Module 3 Challenge due on 11/4. All of the work present has been created by myself, Molly Pfefferkorn. My instructor, Dr. Carl Arrington, provided troubleshooting feedback during the designated office hours of this class. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
---------------------------------------------------------
In this assignment, I created two scripts that use Python to analyze large datasets: PyBank and PyPoll. 

PyBank contains a Python script that reads the "budget_data.csv" file and calculates key financial metrics, including the total number of months, net total profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The script prints these results to the terminal and exports them to a text file. I used Pythonâ€™s CSV module to read the data and stored the results in variables to calculate the required values. I also ensured the script handled the dataset correctly and produced consistent output.

PyPoll contains a Python script that analyzes election data in "election_data.csv". The script calculates the total number of votes, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and determines the winner based on the popular vote. Like PyBank, the script prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file. I utilized Python lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate the voting data, ensuring the analysis was efficient even with large datasets.
